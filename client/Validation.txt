My biggest problem is that I don't know how to find my target market. I am afraid that I am going to ahve a product ready and not be able to find anybody, or that they won't be interested.

In fact, I think this is the kind of product that nobody will be interested in until there is a great demo. It's not the kind of thing that just works on its own

Customer success, tutorials, demos, etc. That's all that works.
